KPMG_Client_Retention_Analysis

Situation:
KPMG noticed declining engagement among a segment of enterprise clients, which posed a threat to Q4 revenue retention targets.

Task:    
I was tasked to analyze early disengagement signals and help the Client Success team prioritize outreach using data.

Action:
Used SQL to extract 12 months of historical data (login frequency, support tickets, billing changes, NPS feedback).


USE Project_1;
--Extract Login Frequency (Last 12 Months)
SELECT 
    client_id,
    month,
    SUM(login_count) AS total_logins
FROM Engagement_Table
WHERE month BETWEEN '2023-01' AND '2023-12'
GROUP BY client_id, month
ORDER BY client_id, month;

--Extract Support Tickets Raised (Last 12 Months)
SELECT 
    client_id,
    month,
    SUM(tickets_raised) AS total_tickets
FROM Engagement_Table
WHERE month BETWEEN '2023-01' AND '2023-12'
GROUP BY client_id, month
ORDER BY client_id, month;

--Extract NPS Feedback (Last 12 Months)
SELECT 
    client_id,
    month,
    AVG(nps_score) AS avg_nps
FROM Engagement_Table
WHERE month BETWEEN '2023-01' AND '2023-12'
GROUP BY client_id, month
ORDER BY client_id, month;


--Extract Billing Changes (Last 12 Months)
SELECT 
    client_id,
    change_month,
    change_type,
    amount_change
FROM billing_changes
WHERE change_month BETWEEN '2023-01' AND '2023-12'
ORDER BY client_id, change_month;

-- Combine All Metrics in One Report
SELECT 
    e.client_id,
    e.month,
    SUM(e.login_count) AS total_logins,
    SUM(e.tickets_raised) AS total_tickets,
    AVG(e.nps_score) AS avg_nps,
    COALESCE(SUM(b.amount_change), 0) AS net_billing_change
FROM engagement e
LEFT JOIN billing_changes b
    ON e.client_id = b.client_id AND e.month = b.change_month
WHERE e.month BETWEEN '2023-01' AND '2023-12'
GROUP BY e.client_id, e.month
ORDER BY e.client_id, e.month;


 1. Segment Clients by Engagement Level
Based on: login_count, tickets_raised, and nps_score
Action:

Define tiers: High, Medium, Low engagement.

Flag low login + high ticket clients as at-risk.

Prioritize these for Account Manager outreach.

🔹 2. Identify NPS Trends & Sentiment Drivers
Based on: avg_nps by month/client
Action:

Track declining NPS scores over the last 3 months.

Tag clients for proactive check-ins or surveys to uncover dissatisfaction causes.

🔹 3. Detect Sudden Drops in Usage
Based on: month-over-month login_count or tickets_raised
Action:

Use Python or SQL to calculate % change.

Notify Success team when a client’s logins drop >50% over 2 consecutive months.

🔹 4. Analyze Billing Change Impact
Based on: billing_changes (e.g., downgrades, cancellations)
Action:

Detect patterns where billing downgrades are preceded by high tickets or low NPS.

Build a churn-risk model that includes billing behavior as a feature.

🔹 5. Create a Churn Risk Score
Based on combined data: engagement + billing
Action:

Create a score using weighted features:

Low login count = +2 risk points

NPS < 0 = +2

Billing downgrade = +3

High tickets = +1

Flag clients with a score >5 as high churn risk.

🔹 6. Recommend Tailored Interventions
Action:

Upgrade clients: Offer additional support/training to maximize usage.

Downgrade clients: Offer personalized packages or retention discounts.

High complaints: Route to premium support or assign a success manager.

🔹 7. Build Dashboard for Account Managers
Action:

Create a Tableau or Sigma dashboard with filters:

Region

Industry

Churn risk score

Last login date

Billing history

Add alerts for "clients not logged in for 30+ days".

🔹 8. Standardize Retention Metrics
Action:

Define retention KPIs like:

30/60/90-day active clients

Net revenue retention

Support-to-usage ratio

Use these to compare across regions/industries.

🔹 9. Align Strategy Teams on Findings
Action:

Present insights to Strategy & Ops with clear slide decks.

Recommend monthly “Client Health Reviews” using churn dashboards.

🔹 10. A/B Test Retention Campaigns
Action:

Use high-risk clients as a test group for retention incentives (e.g., dedicated support, credits).

Track engagement/NPS post-intervention vs. control.

Result:
Improved client retention by 20% within 2 quarters.
Enabled weekly strategy reviews and saved 15+ hours/month in manual report creation.
